Blood Cell Classification with Deep Learning

A deep learning-powered web app to classify blood cell images into 5 medical cell types using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model and a clean, professional Gradio frontend.

Project Highlights:

Built with TensorFlow + Gradio

Uses ResNet50 for feature extraction

Classifies into 5 types of blood cells

Medical-themed responsive UI

Perfect for demos, medical tools, or educational use

Classes Predicted:

Basophil

Erythroblast

Monocyte

Myeloblast

Segmented Neutrophil
